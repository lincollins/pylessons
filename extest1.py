# This is a test file
# We want to get an extension from a different file extest
# Would see if it would work
# Ok, so it works
# Gov, please when doing an import, kindly do well to use 2 words
# For instance 'game_dope'
# If not use any random letter instead
# For instance 'gaqy'
# If you ant to use a reasonable word, they should come in 2's
# If not use only random letters like 'chl', 'gaqy', 'uol' among others

from kline import gaqy
gaqy()
