# In here we learn logic
# We would give you the basics of the formula
# Yes, to make it simple and easy

# What we learn in here is also known as Boolean Logic

# Anything in 'OR' is positive which is true

# Anything in 'AND' is negative which is false

# Anything 'NOT OR' is the same as 'AND' except same inputs which negates
# As in 'True - True' False-------- 'False - False' True

# Anything 'NOT AND' is the same as 'OR' except same input which negates
# As in 'True - True' False-------- 'False - False' True

# And well if its not True, its False
# If its not False, its True
