# Just thought I should let you know Dawn
# You have done well in memorising the boolean logic
# Yeah, you had few wrongs, 4 of them.
# But you did great actually :)
# Thumbs up

# Now we move to the next Python script
# Which is the if-statement
# Game on Dawn

people = 20
cats = 30
dogs = 15
cars = 45
houses = 75



# if kofi != ama:
	# print "So Kofi is a man, Ama is a girl" # Slim and fair actually :)
						# Der n) Dawn start dey think :)
						# Bad boooy. I can see yooooooou :)

if people < cats: # This will print because the 'if definition' is true. 
	print "Too many cats! The world is doomed!"

if people > cats: # This will not print because the 'if definition' is not true
	print "Not many cats! The world is saved!"
    
if people < dogs: # This ill not print because the 'if definition' is not true
	print "The world is drooled on!"

if people > dogs: # This will print because the 'if definition' is true
	print "The world is dry!"

dogs += 5 # This is more or less like adding '5' to the already defined '15' dogs

if people >= dogs: # This will print the statement. For 'dogs = 20, people = 20'
	print "People are less than equal to dogs."

if people <= dogs: # Same here
	print "People are less than equal to dogs."

if people == dogs: # Same here
	print "People are dogs" # Dont like this statement actually :)

# We are trying some observations here. With regards to space indentation
# Hm, not really a difference. Nothing has changed actually
# No error, whether with a single space or 4 indented spaces
# However we would have to admit that with not even a single indentation
# There would be an error. Yeah Indentation block
# Well i guess we ve to maintain the 'tab' indentation

if cats > dogs: 
	print "Yes cats are in a comfortable lead!"

if cars != houses:
	print "Hm, some Dawn movement"

if houses >= dogs:
	print "Welcome guys"

# From observation, what the if statement does is that
# When the defined format strings is true, it will print 
# The statement down it
# But if its not true, it will not print it
