# Now its time to pick up the pace.
# Lets do some 'real' software thing
# All along we have been printing
# We havnt taken in any inputs talkless of changing it
# Dont worry Dawn, we are inline :)
# You should go online to find out what python 'raw_input' does :)

print "How old are you?",
age = raw_input ()

print "How tall are you?",
height = raw_input()

print "How much do you weigh?",
weight = raw_input()

print "So, you're %r old, %r tall and %r heavy." % (age, height, weight)
