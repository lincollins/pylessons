# This is an update on variables used in test4.py
# In here, we are going to use some varaibles in a form of letters 
# To do some calculations 
# As you know, you must equate your variable to something. It should ve a partner :)

a = 4
j = 2
q = 1
i = 8

print "a + j" # This does not print out the required result :( '6'
print "i + q" # Instead, it prints out i + q
print "j + q" # It prints out the letters as they are on the screen :(
print "a + i" # That is not the target, lets try something else, 

print a + j # Ok, so this one works :)
print i + q # When using 2 patnering variables raw, dont add any quotes
print j + q # To it. If quotes are added, they wont be printed as a 'variable'
print a + i # Defined earlier on but rather as they are on the screen 
print a / q
print q * i
print a + q / i
print i / q - a
