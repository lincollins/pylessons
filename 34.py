# Accessing lists in a file
# Ok, so we are doing some 'Ordinal' and 'Cardinal' numbers

# Boss Dawn, Ordinal numbers mean number which are in order (1,2,3,4,5,6,...)
# Cardinal numbers means numbers at random (1,3,2,5,8,4,)

# The differnce basically is that programmers use cardinal numbers in code
# They dont use the regualr ordinal numbers we know

# For instance [goat, cow, python, mouse]
# In the above example, using Ordinal numbers, we would say the cow is 2nd in the list
# However, in cardinal terms, the cow is 1st
# Surprised? This is becasue we started our dreadings from Zero (0)

# Cardinal numbers always begin from zero. Yes

# animals = ['bear', 'tiger', 'penguin', 'zebra']
# bear = animals[0]

# The above illustration is how we call an animal or so.
# In order to specify which animal at random obviously using Cardinals,
# We bring in bear then followed by animal and then specify the number we want
# Remember its in cardinal. So for instance 'Tiger' would be 1 instead of 2

# With the statement: The animal at 1, we are talking in terms of cardinal
# The 3rd animal, we talking in ordinal terms

# Ok Dawn, do well to read about CArdinal and Ordnial numbers online in full please :)
# And well, we just heard you are very good at typing things very fast now :)
# With loads of mistakes. ooops. not good for raport :)

animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platyppus']

The animal at 1 # The animal at 1 is a 'python'
The 3rd animal  # The 3rd animal is peacock
The 1st animal  # The 1st animal is bear
The animal at 3 # The animal at 3 is  a kangaroo
The 5th animal  # The 5th animal is a whale
The animal at 2 # The animal at 2 is a peacock
The 6th animal  # The 6th animal is a platypus
The animal at 4 # The animal at 4 is a whale
